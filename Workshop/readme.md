# Must Learn KQL workshop

The PowerPoint deck available for [download from here](https://github.com/rod-trent/MustLearnKQL/blob/main/Workshop/Must%20Learn%20KQL%20-%20Workshop.pptx) has gone through a 6-month private preview program that saw delivery to over 200 attendees. This is the culmination of the Must Learn KQL learning series, but in an easy to deliver workshop format.
